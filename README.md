# Notes for Collection frameworks Lessons #
### Files structures
- All the main files are in src dir
- if you see out, that is the generated files from jvm
### Topics
* List(Arraylist, linkedlist)
* Linkedlist
  * can extend both list and queue
  * add, remove, set, contains empty pull poll addNext ...
* queue(First-in-first-out) just like in grocery stores cashiers
  * push(), pop(), peek(), size()
  * extends collections interface
  * you can use linkedlist and priorityqueue to use queue
* stack(Last-in-first-out) just like Pringles
  * it extends Vector class and vector extends list
  * push, pop, peek, size
* tree data structure
* BFS and DFS 
* Hashmap and hashset
  * Hashset is not in order and it does not hold duplicate values 
  * hashmap has key,value combination(best for data handling)
* FileHandling
  * use File class and its method(createNewfile()) to create a file
  * use Filewriter class to write
  * use Scanner to read
